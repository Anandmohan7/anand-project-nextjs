This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Task Completed

-Create a website similar to the one provided in the Figma design: Followed the same layout for the website.
-Create a feature to toggle between light and dark mode: Instead of adding the toggle on the header its available on the right-bottom side of the website
-Add a working carousel for the first section: Used ShadCN carousal to implement this functionality
-Add a "count-up animation" in the statistics section: Used Hooks to Implement the animation which will start once the section is in the view. Also used framer motion for the animation.
